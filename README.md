# UXer Toolbox
This is the GitHub repo for my website "UXer Toolbox". This website is created because I wanted to have a place where I can conveniently access the tools that I frequently use while doing my UX design work.
## Website URL

## Built with

 - [Bulma](https://bulma.io/): CSS framework
 - [Buefy](https://buefy.org/): UI components for Vue.js based on Bulma
 - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): JavaScript framework

 - [Color Thief](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/): JavaScript library to extract color palette from images

## Current Tools
Currently, there are four tools that I've created: Color Converter, Color Mixer (Gradient), Color Scheme Generator, and Font Comparer.

**Color Converter**

 - Supports conversion across RGB, Hex, HSL, HWB, and CMYK. 
 - The background of this section will change dynamically according to the color input. 
 - User input is saved locally using localStorage.

**Color Mixer (Gradient)**

 - Takes two Hex colors and generates colors between the two (using RGB scheme). 
 - The number of colors is based on the slider input. 
 - The background of this section will be a linear gradient of the two color inputs.
 - User can copy a color by clicking on the tags generated.
 - User input is saved locally using localStorage.

**Color Scheme Generator**

 - Takes one Hex color input and generates the following color schemes: 
	 - complementary
	 - monochromatic
	 - split-complementary
	 - 30Â° analogous
	 - triadic
	 - tetradic
	 - square.
 - User can copy a color by clicking on the tags generated.
 - User input is saved locally using localStorage.

**Font Comparer**

 - Allows users to choose two fonts available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and display some user-inputted characters side-by-side.
 - Uses webfont loader to dynamically load chosen fonts from Google Fonts.

**Palette Extractor**

 - Allows users to upload an image and extract a color palette with 10 colors from it.
 - The image is not saved anywhere.
